# Frontend Error Analysis and Fixes

## Error Summary

### 1. Window Event Listener Error
**Occurrences**: 2
**Error Message**: 
```
[TypeError: window.addEventListener is not a function (it is undefined)]
```
**Location**: `mobile/store/auth.ts:253`
**Context**:
```typescript
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  window.addEventListener('auth:logout', (event: any) => {
    console.log('Global auth logout triggered:', event.detail?.reason);
    actions.logout();
  });
}
```
**Root Cause**: Attempting to use web browser's `window` API in React Native environment, which doesn't have access to browser APIs.

**Fix Required**:
1. Replace `window.addEventListener` with React Native's event system
2. Use either `EventEmitter` from React Native or a state management solution like Redux
3. Example approach:
   ```typescript
   import { DeviceEventEmitter } from 'react-native';
   
   // Instead of window.addEventListener:
   DeviceEventEmitter.addListener('auth:logout', (data) => {
     console.log('Global auth logout triggered:', data?.reason);
     actions.logout();
   });
   ```

### 2. Layout Warning
**Occurrences**: 4
**Warning Message**: 
```
Layout children must be of type Screen, all other children are ignored. To use custom children, create a custom <Layout />
```
**Location**: `app/_layout.tsx`
**Root Cause**: Using non-Screen components directly as children of Layout component in the app's navigation structure.

**Fix Required**:
1. Ensure all direct children of Layout components are Screen components
2. Wrap custom components inside Screen components
3. Example structure:
   ```typescript
   <Layout>
     <Screen name="home">
       <CustomComponent />
     </Screen>
     <Screen name="profile">
       <AnotherCustomComponent />
     </Screen>
   </Layout>
   ```

## Additional Observations

### Information Messages
1. "Attempting to refresh access token..." - Working as expected
2. "Access token stored, refresh token not provided or invalid" - Not an error, but might need investigation
3. "Access token refreshed successfully" - Working as expected
4. "Push token sent to backend successfully" - Working as expected
5. "Notification system initialized successfully" - Working as expected
6. "Database initialized successfully" - Working as expected
7. "No conversations found - user has no conversations yet" - Expected behavior for new users

## Next Steps

1. **High Priority**:
   - Fix the window.addEventListener issue in auth.ts
   - Correct Layout component structure in _layout.tsx

2. **Investigation Needed**:
   - Review token refresh logic to ensure proper token management
   - Verify if the missing refresh token is expected behavior

3. **Testing Required**:
   - Verify authentication flow after implementing event system fix
   - Test layout rendering with corrected Screen components
   - Validate notification system functionality
   - Test conversation loading with existing user data

## Implementation Notes

- Keep existing functionality while replacing window.addEventListener
- Document any changes to the event system for team reference
- Consider adding error boundaries around critical components
- Add logging for debugging authentication flow
- Consider implementing automated tests for these scenarios
