# Backend Server Fix Plan

## Problem Analysis

Based on the Railway logs, the backend server is crashing with the following error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/app/dist/index.js'
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Main Server File**: The `src/index.ts` file doesn't exist, which is the main entry point for the Express server
2. **Missing Build Process**: The TypeScript code hasn't been compiled to JavaScript in the `dist/` directory
3. **Incomplete Backend Structure**: The backend only has the database configuration but lacks the core server implementation
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Some required dependencies may not be installed or properly configured

## Issues to Fix

### 1. Missing Core Server Files
- No `src/index.ts` (main server entry point)
- No Express app configuration
- No route handlers
- No middleware setup

### 2. Build Configuration Issues
- TypeScript compilation not working properly
- Missing build output in `dist/` directory
- Railway deployment trying to run non-existent compiled files

### 3. Missing Authentication System
- No JWT utilities (Task 3.1 not completed)
- No auth middleware
- No auth routes and controllers
- No user registration/login endpoints

### 4. Missing Core API Structure
- No Express server setup
- No CORS configuration
- No error handling middleware
- No API routes structure

## Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Server Setup
1. Create main Express server file (`src/index.ts`)
2. Set up basic Express configuration
3. Add essential middleware (CORS, body-parser, error handling)
4. Create basic health check endpoint

### Phase 2: Authentication System
1. Implement JWT utility functions
2. Create authentication middleware
3. Build auth service and controller
4. Set up auth routes

### Phase 3: Build and Deployment
1. Fix TypeScript build configuration
2. Ensure proper compilation to `dist/` directory
3. Test local build process
4. Verify Railway deployment configuration

### Phase 4: Database Integration
1. Integrate Prisma client with Express server
2. Add database connection handling
3. Implement proper error handling for database operations

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these fixes:
- Backend server will start successfully on Railway
- Basic API endpoints will be available
- Authentication system will be functional
- Database connections will work properly
- Build process will generate correct output files

## Priority Level: HIGH
This is blocking the entire backend deployment and needs immediate attention.
