Perfect! I can see you have an Expo React Native app. Here's how to use your Mac as an emulator for your mobile app:

## Setting Up Your Mac as an Emulator for MessageAI

### 1. Install Required Tools

First, you'll need to install the necessary development tools:

**Install Xcode (for iOS Simulator):**
```bash
# Install Xcode from the Mac App Store (free)
# This includes the iOS Simulator
```

**Install Android Studio (for Android Emulator):**
```bash
# Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
# Or install via Homebrew:
brew install --cask android-studio
```

**Install Expo CLI (if not already installed):**
```bash
npm install -g @expo/cli
```

### 2. Set Up iOS Simulator

1. **Open Xcode** and go to **Xcode > Preferences > Components**
2. **Download iOS Simulator** for the iOS version you want to test
3. **Open Simulator** from Xcode or by running:
   ```bash
   open -a Simulator
   ```

### 3. Set Up Android Emulator

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. Go to **Tools > AVD Manager**
3. **Create a new Virtual Device**:
   - Choose a device (e.g., Pixel 6)
   - Select an Android version (API level)
   - Configure hardware settings
   - Click "Finish"

### 4. Running Your App

Navigate to your mobile directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd /Users/joaocarlinho/gauntlet/messageAI/mobile
```

**For iOS Simulator:**
```bash
npm run ios
# or
expo start --ios
```

**For Android Emulator:**
```bash
npm run android
# or
expo start --android
```

**For Web (runs in browser):**
```bash
npm run web
# or
expo start --web
```

**For Expo Go (scan QR code with your phone):**
```bash
npm start
# or
expo start
```

### 5. Development Workflow

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

2. **Choose your platform:**
   - Press `i` for iOS Simulator
   - Press `a` for Android Emulator
   - Press `w` for web browser
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone

3. **Hot Reload:** Your app will automatically reload when you make changes to the code

### 6. Useful Commands

```bash
# Clear cache if you encounter issues
expo start --clear

# Run on specific platform
expo start --ios
expo start --android
expo start --web

# Build for production
expo build:ios
expo build:android
```

### 7. Troubleshooting Tips

- **If iOS Simulator doesn't open:** Make sure Xcode is properly installed and you've accepted the license agreement
- **If Android Emulator is slow:** Increase RAM allocation in AVD Manager
- **If you get Metro bundler errors:** Try `expo start --clear`
- **For network issues:** Make sure your backend is running and accessible

### 8. Testing Your MessageAI App

Since your app uses:
- **Socket.io** for real-time messaging
- **Expo Notifications** for push notifications
- **React Native Paper** for UI components

Make sure to test:
- Real-time messaging between devices
- Push notifications (may require physical device for full testing)
- UI responsiveness across different screen sizes

The iOS Simulator and Android Emulator will give you a great development experience, though some features like push notifications work best on physical devices.
