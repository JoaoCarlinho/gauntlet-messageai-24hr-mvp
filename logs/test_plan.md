# Railway Build Monitoring & Review Plan

## Overview
This plan establishes a systematic approach to monitor, review, and validate Railway backend service builds when branches are merged to master on the remote repository.

## 1. Automated Build Monitoring

### 1.1 Railway Webhook Integration
- **Setup**: Configure Railway webhooks to notify on build events
- **Events to Monitor**:
  - Build started
  - Build completed (success/failure)
  - Deployment started
  - Deployment completed
- **Notification Channels**:
  - Email alerts for build failures
  - Slack/Discord integration for team notifications
  - GitHub commit status updates

### 1.2 GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/railway-build-monitor.yml
name: Railway Build Monitor
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  monitor-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check Railway Build Status
        run: |
          # Monitor Railway build via API
          curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}" \
               https://backboard.railway.app/graphql \
               -d '{"query": "query { deployments { id status createdAt } }"}'
      
      - name: Notify on Build Failure
        if: failure()
        run: |
          # Send notification to team channels
          echo "Railway build failed for commit ${{ github.sha }}"
```

## 2. Build Review Process

### 2.1 Pre-Merge Validation
- **Branch Protection Rules**:
  - Require PR reviews before merge
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Require up-to-date branches
- **Automated Checks**:
  - TypeScript compilation
  - Linting (ESLint)
  - Unit tests execution
  - Integration tests

### 2.2 Post-Merge Monitoring
- **Immediate Actions** (0-5 minutes):
  - Monitor Railway build logs in real-time
  - Check for TypeScript compilation errors
  - Verify dependency installation
  - Monitor build progress

- **Build Validation** (5-15 minutes):
  - Review build output for warnings/errors
  - Verify all services start correctly
  - Check database migrations (if any)
  - Validate environment variable configuration

- **Deployment Verification** (15-30 minutes):
  - Test API endpoints health check
  - Verify database connectivity
  - Check external service integrations
  - Monitor application logs for errors

## 3. Build Review Checklist

## 4. Monitoring Tools & Scripts

### 4.1 Build Status Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/check-railway-build.sh

RAILWAY_TOKEN=$1
PROJECT_ID=$2

# Get latest deployment status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $RAILWAY_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "query { deployments(limit: 1) { id status createdAt logs { message } } }"}' \
     https://backboard.railway.app/graphql | jq '.data.deployments[0]'
```

### 4.2 Health Check Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/health-check.sh

API_URL=$1
MAX_RETRIES=10
RETRY_DELAY=30

for i in $(seq 1 $MAX_RETRIES); do
  echo "Health check attempt $i/$MAX_RETRIES"
  
  if curl -f -s "$API_URL/health" > /dev/null; then
    echo "✅ Health check passed"
    exit 0
  fi
  
  echo "❌ Health check failed, retrying in $RETRY_DELAY seconds..."
  sleep $RETRY_DELAY
done

echo "❌ Health check failed after $MAX_RETRIES attempts"
exit 1
```

### 4.3 Log Monitoring Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/monitor-logs.sh

RAILWAY_TOKEN=$1
DEPLOYMENT_ID=$2

# Stream logs in real-time
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $RAILWAY_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
     "https://backboard.railway.app/graphql" \
     -d '{"query": "subscription { deploymentLogs(deploymentId: \"'$DEPLOYMENT_ID'\") { message timestamp } }"}'
```
