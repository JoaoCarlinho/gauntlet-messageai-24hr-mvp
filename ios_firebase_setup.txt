Use Swift Package Manager to install and manage Firebase dependencies.

In Xcode, with your app project open, navigate to File > Add Packages
When prompted, enter the Firebase iOS SDK repository URL:
https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
Select the SDK version that you want to use.
We recommend using the default (latest) SDK version, but you can use an older version, if needed.

Choose the Firebase libraries that you want to use.
Make sure to add FirebaseAnalytics. For Analytics without IDFA collection capability, add FirebaseAnalyticsWithoutAdId instead.

After you click Finish, Xcode will automatically begin resolving and downloading your dependencies in the background.




To connect Firebase when your app starts up, add the initialization code below to your app's main entry point.


with

Swift


import UIKit
import FirebaseCore


@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

  var window: UIWindow?

  func application(_ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:
      [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    FirebaseApp.configure()

    return true
  }
}
